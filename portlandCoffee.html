                  Usually regarded as being in Seattle&rsquo;s shadow, Portland has emerged in the past decade as a leader in coffee innovation. Home to many independent shops, roasters, and retailers among other service providers, Portland provides a unique and eclectic experience for anyone&rsquo;s tastes.

                  We would like to highlight three of the more popular shops in town. Each is unique in presentation with offerings of multiple orgins using espresso, pourover, and drip methods.
